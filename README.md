### Image Processing with CLIP Example

This series of images demonstrates various image transformations applied to a single source image. Each transformation showcases different techniques that can be used for image processing, potentially using models like CLIP or image manipulation libraries.

1. **Original Image**: 
   - The first image shows the original picture of a person holding a camera outdoors, in full color with no applied transformations. 

2. **Grayscale Conversion**:
   - The second image is a grayscale version of the original image. This technique removes color information and highlights texture and lighting contrast, which can be useful for analyzing image features.

3. **Rotation**:
   - The third image is the result of a rotation operation. This technique rotates the image by a certain angle, showing how the perspective of an image can change through geometric transformations.

4. **90-degree Rotation**:
   - The fourth image shows the original image rotated by 90 degrees. This simple transformation alters the orientation of the image, demonstrating basic image manipulation techniques.

5. **Blurred Image**:
   - The fifth image appears to have a blur effect applied to it. Blurring is used to soften the details of an image and is commonly applied in preprocessing steps to reduce noise or in specific visual effects.

Each transformation can be useful in different contexts, especially in machine learning tasks such as feature extraction, training neural networks, or image classification.
